# SRS: Software Requirements Specification

## PassDown

| | |
|---|---|
| **Project** | PassDown, a course-material sharing platform |
| **Course** | CSE 309 Web Applications & Internet, Independent University, Bangladesh (IUB) |
| **Author** | Tanjil Hasan Emon |
| **ID** | 2331024 |
| **Version** | 1.0 (Draft) |
| **Date** | October 2026 |
| **Related documents** | [PRD: Product Requirements Document](./01-prd.md) · [TDD: Technical Design Document](./03-tdd.md) |

> Every requirement is tagged **MVP** (mid-term demo, runs locally, no login) or **Beta** (final demo, authentication, RBAC, deployment).

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document specifies what PassDown must do. It is written for the course evaluator and for the developer, and it is the reference for implementation and testing. The product context and release plan are in the [PRD](./01-prd.md); the technical solution is in the [TDD](./03-tdd.md).

### 1.2 Scope
PassDown lets students browse, request and contribute **links** to course materials, organised per course. Admin-curated core materials give each course a reliable baseline. The system stores no files, only links.

### 1.3 Definitions

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Core material | A link to a resource added by an admin; always public |
| Contribution | A link to a resource submitted by a user; public only after approval |
| Request | A post asking for a material that is missing |
| CRUD | Create, Read, Update, Delete |
| REST | Representational State Transfer, the style of the HTTP API |
| JWT | JSON Web Token, a signed token used to prove who is calling the API |
| RBAC | Role-Based Access Control |
| Scope | A named permission (for example `courses:write`) stored in the JWT |
| Owner | The user who created a contribution or request |
| Guest | A visitor without an account or without being logged in |

### 1.4 References

## 2. Overall description

### 2.1 Product perspective
PassDown is a standalone full-stack web application: a React + TypeScript single-page frontend calling a FastAPI REST backend under `/api/v1`, backed by a relational database. Frontend and backend are deployed together as one Vercel project.

### 2.2 Roles

| Role | Type | Release | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Visitor** | Anonymous | MVP | Everyone in MVP, because there is no login yet. Can use every feature. |
| **Guest** | Anonymous | Beta | Not logged in. Read-only access to public content. |
| **`student`** | Global role | Beta | Registered user. Can contribute and request. |
| **`admin`** | Global role | Beta | Maintainer. Manages courses, core materials, moderation and users. |
| **Owner** | Per-item | Beta | The user who created a contribution or request. |

### 2.3 Constraints
- Frontend must be React + TypeScript; backend must be FastAPI + Python.
- Must use REST APIs, authentication, RBAC and security scopes (Beta).
- Must run on free-tier hosting: Vercel (app) and Supabase (database).
- No file storage; only external links.

### 2.4 Assumptions
- Users already host their files on a cloud service and share links.
- Courses are created by admins only.

## 8. Acceptance criteria

Format: **Given** a starting state, **When** an action happens, **Then** the expected result.

### MVP

| ID | Req | Criterion |
|---|---|---|
| AC-01 | FR-01, FR-02 | **Given** courses CSE309, CSE433 and MAT101 exist, **When** `GET /courses?q=cse` is called, **Then** it returns `200` with only CSE309 and CSE433. |
| AC-02 | FR-03, FR-22 | **Given** no course with id 999, **When** `GET /courses/999` is called, **Then** it returns `404`. |
| AC-03 | FR-04, FR-22 | **Given** a course with code CSE309 exists, **When** a course with the same code is created, **Then** it returns `409`. |
| AC-04 | FR-04, FR-21 | **Given** a valid body, **When** `POST /courses` is called, **Then** it returns `201` with the new course; **and** with an empty title it returns `422`. |
| AC-05 | FR-06 | **Given** a course with one material, one contribution and one request, **When** the course is deleted, **Then** it returns `204` and the related rows are gone. |
| AC-06 | FR-07 | **Given** a course with `slides` and `notes` materials, **When** `GET /courses/{id}/core-materials?type=notes` is called, **Then** only `notes` items are returned. |
| AC-07 | FR-08, FR-21 | **Given** an existing course, **When** a material with URL `ftp://x.com/a` is created, **Then** it returns `422`; with an `https` URL it returns `201`. |
| AC-08 | FR-12 | **Given** an existing course, **When** a contribution is created, **Then** it returns `201` with status `pending`. |
| AC-09 | FR-11 | **Given** one pending and one approved contribution, **When** `GET /courses/{id}/contributions` is called, **Then** only the approved one is returned. |
| AC-10 | FR-13 | **Given** an approved contribution, **When** it is edited, **Then** it returns `409`. |
| AC-11 | FR-15 | **Given** a pending contribution, **When** its status is set to `approved`, **Then** it returns `200` and it appears in the public list; **and** setting `pending` returns `422`. |
| AC-12 | FR-16 | **Given** pending contributions in two courses, **When** `GET /contributions?status=pending` is called, **Then** both are returned. |
| AC-13 | FR-17 to FR-20 | **Given** an existing course, **When** a request is created, **Then** its status is `open`; **and** after `PATCH /requests/{id}/fulfill` it is `fulfilled`, and repeating the call keeps it `fulfilled`; **and** deleting it returns `204`. |
| AC-14 | FR-24 | **Given** the backend and frontend are running, **When** a visitor opens `/`, **Then** the course list is shown and typing in the search box filters it. |

### Beta

| ID | Req | Criterion |
|---|---|---|
| AC-15 | FR-28, NFR-18 | **Given** a new email, **When** a user registers, **Then** it returns `201` with role `student` and no password field; a duplicate email returns `409`; a weak password returns `422`; a body containing `role: admin` still creates a `student`. |
| AC-16 | FR-29, FR-30, NFR-15 | **Given** a registered user, **When** they log in with the right password, **Then** they get a token and `GET /me` returns their profile; with a wrong password they get `401` with a generic message. |
| AC-17 | FR-31 | **Given** 5 failed logins for an account, **When** a 6th login is attempted within 15 minutes, **Then** it returns `429`, even with the correct password. |
| AC-18 | FR-32 | **Given** no token, **When** `POST /courses/{id}/contributions` is called, **Then** it returns `401`. |

| AC-20 | FR-34 | **Given** a student token, **When** `PATCH /contributions/{id}/status` is called, **Then** it returns `403`; with an admin token it returns `200`. |
| AC-21 | FR-35 | **Given** a contribution created by student A, **When** student B deletes it, **Then** it returns `403`; student A gets `204`; an admin gets `204`. |
| AC-22 | FR-36 | **Given** student A has 2 pending and 1 approved contribution, **When** `GET /me/summary` is called, **Then** it returns those counts and does not include other users' items. |
| AC-23 | FR-37 | **Given** a logged-in user, **When** they change the password with a wrong current password, **Then** it returns `400`; with the right one it returns `204` and the old password no longer works. |
| AC-24 | FR-38 | **Given** an admin token, **When** `GET /admin/stats` is called, **Then** it returns the counts; with a student token it returns `403`. |
| AC-25 | FR-39, FR-40 | **Given** an active student, **When** an admin deactivates them, **Then** their next login returns `403` and their existing token returns `401`; an admin deactivating themselves gets `409`. |
| AC-26 | FR-43, FR-44 | **Given** a guest, **When** they open `/admin` or `/dashboard`, **Then** they are redirected to `/login`; **and** a student opening `/admin` sees a "not authorized" page; **and** an expired token returns the user to `/login`. |
| AC-27 | FR-41 | **Given** an empty database and admin variables set, **When** the seed command runs twice, **Then** exactly one admin exists. |
| AC-28 | FR-42 | **Given** the production deployment, **When** data is created and the app is redeployed, **Then** the data is still there. |
| AC-29 | FR-45 | **Given** a student with 2 pending contributions, **When** they open `/dashboard`, **Then** they see the counts and both contributions with their status. |
| AC-30 | FR-46 | **Given** an admin, **When** they open `/admin`, **Then** they see the pending queue, the statistics and the user list, and can approve, reject and deactivate from there. |
