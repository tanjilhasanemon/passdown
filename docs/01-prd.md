# PRD: Product Requirements Document

## PassDown

| | |
|---|---|
| **Project** | PassDown, a course-material sharing platform |
| **Course** | CSE 309 Web Applications & Internet, Independent University, Bangladesh (IUB) |
| **Author** | Tanjil Hasan Emon |
| **ID** | 2331024 |
| **Version** | 1.0 (Draft) |
| **Date** | October 2026 |
| **Related documents** | [SRS: Software Requirements Specification](./02-srs.md) · [TDD: Technical Design Document](./03-tdd.md) |

> Every goal, feature and user story in this document is tagged **MVP** or **Beta**, so it is clear what is shown at each demo.

---

## 1. Overview

PassDown is a web application that helps university students prepare for a course **before** they take it. Today the only way to preview a course during a semester gap is to find a senior and ask for their notes, which is inconsistent and does not scale.

PassDown gives every course one organised page with three sections:

- **Core Materials**: a curated, reliable set of links managed by admins.
- **Contributions**: links submitted by students and reviewed by an admin before they become public.
- **Requests**: posts where students ask for materials they cannot find.

PassDown does **not** host files. It stores and organises **links** (Google Drive, OneDrive, GitHub, etc.), so it is lightweight and runs on free-tier hosting.

## 2. Release plan

The project ships in two releases.

    end

    end
    M4 --> B1
```

| Release | Demo | What is shown |
|---|---|---|
| **MVP** | Mid-term (Week 7) | Courses, core materials, contributions and requests through REST APIs (CRUD) and a React + TypeScript UI, running locally on SQLite. No login yet. |
| **Beta** | Final (Week 12) | Authentication (JWT), user roles (RBAC), security scopes, profile dashboard, admin dashboard, security hardening, and production deployment on Vercel with Supabase PostgreSQL. |

## 3. Problem statement and goals

**Problem.** Students who want to prepare for a course in advance have no central, reliable place to find its materials. They depend on personal connections with seniors, which excludes students who do not have those connections.

| ID | Release | Goal |
|---|---|---|
| G-01 | MVP | Give every course one organised page of material links. |
| G-02 | MVP | Let students request and contribute materials, with a review status for contributions. |
| G-03 | Beta | Control who can do what through authentication, role-based access control (RBAC) and security scopes. |
| G-04 | Beta | Run securely in production at zero cost (Vercel and Supabase free tiers). |
| G-05 | MVP, Beta | Demonstrate a professional workflow: issues, feature branches, pull requests and a Kanban board. |

## 4. Target users

| User | Role in the system | Release | Needs |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Prospective student** | Guest (no account) in MVP, `student` in Beta | MVP, Beta | Browse and search course materials, request missing ones. |
| **Contributor** | `student` | MVP (open), Beta (logged in) | Share links to materials they already have. |
| **Maintainer (senior)** | `admin` | MVP (open), Beta (logged in) | Curate core materials, manage courses, review contributions, oversee users. |

## 5. Scope

| Area | In scope: MVP | In scope: Beta |
|---|---|---|
| Content | Courses, core materials, contributions, requests (CRUD), contribution review status | Contribution approval restricted to admins, ownership rules |
| Access | Open API, no login | Register and login (JWT), roles `student` and `admin`, security scopes |
| Users | None | Profile dashboard, change name and password, admin user management |
| Admin | Management and moderation pages (not protected) | Admin dashboard with moderation queue and statistics |

## 10. Assumptions and risks

**Assumptions**
- Users store the actual files on their own cloud storage and share links.
- The course list is managed by admins only, so catalog data stays clean.
- Free-tier limits (cold starts, database size) are acceptable for an academic project.

**Risks**

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Scope creep | Features are fixed per release; extra ideas go to "Future" in section 6. |
| Dead or unsafe links | Admin review before publishing; only `http` and `https` URLs accepted; external-link notice in the UI. |
| Time pressure before demos | MVP is intentionally small; Beta items are ordered by priority (Must before Should). |
